# hacking

This guide to hacking on the code for this project will hopefully be helpful to contributors and myself.

The first phase of this project is to re-implement the data structures and game logic, there will be no graphical parts to these, but there will be unit tests for checking data integrity and game logic.

### software.lua, hardware.lua, chips.lua

This handles the in-game software, hardware and chips you can plug/load into your deck. It also calculates the price for these items, and get their display text.

  software = require("software")

software.types lists all the types of software available, along with the complexity of each, and a list of predefined names.

To create a new instance call `software("type", rating)`

# tests

Unit tests are implemented with the included luaunit module. To run all tests:

  lua test-all.lua -v

To run your test file stand-alone:

  lua yourTests.lua

# questions new players might ask - or tips to become a better hacker

* a warning should be shown if the player starts a new chip project, and they don't own a chip burner.
* what is lifestyle and reputation, and how do they affect my game?
* why do I have so many types of chips (co processor, attack, defense...) in my decker? 
* when and how is my attack/defend rating modified?
* how do I heal?
* how do I turn off a red alert?
* do ICE come back after I crashed them?
* will I ever get reported to the police?
* how do I prevent the sysadmin from shutting down the system in a red alert?
* what happens if I get traced and how can I stop it?
* analyze a gateway or tapeworm before deceiving/decrypting. It reduces the ICE rating, increasing your chances.

# port notes

* The original game source can be found on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/decker/files/decker/Decker%201.12/). The `Help/Decker.rtf` file is particulary helpful.

* These ICE types were never implemented:
  * AST_CRASH

* These ICE abilities were never implemented:
  * hardened
  * phasing
  * trace and dump
  * trace and fry
  * killer
  * trace dump
  * trace burn

# variations from the original

* ICE names vary if they are of the hareded, phasing, crashing or lethal sub-types, these are implemented. The orignal game additionally had names lists for the combinations of lethal+hardened, lethal+phasing and lethal+crash sub-types. This is no longer the case. These combinations now simply use the one "lethal" list of names.

* ICE behaviour flags "crash", "dump" and "fry" have changed to "crasher", "dumper" and "fryer".
